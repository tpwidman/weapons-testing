**Sanguine Dirk**

_Weapon (dagger), rare_

> This fighting dagger was clearly made with care—a balanced single-edged blade, subtle forward curve, simple wooden grip that fits your hand too well. At first glance it appears to be an exceptionally well-preserved ornamental weapon, but the narrow fuller along the spine is stained with permanent deep red, and the steel feels tired. This was once beautiful.
> 
> You feel sorry for it, which is a strange thing to feel about a weapon. You try rubbing away the dirt from the blade, but the red stain won't come off—it's _in_ the steel, not on it. Someone commissioned this. Someone carried it with pride. Holding it feels less like wielding a weapon and more like carrying someone who can't walk on their own.

**Properties:** Magic weapon, +1 to attack and damage rolls | 1d4 piercing damage | Finesse, light, thrown (range 20/60)

**Blood Sense:** You sense the presence of living creatures with blood within 30 feet, even through walls (direction only, not exact location).

**Bleed Counter:** You track a bleed counter for one creature with blood. When you hit that creature:

*   **Normal hit:** Roll 1d4, add to counter
*   **Hit with advantage:** Roll 1d8, add to counter
*   **Critical hit:** Roll 2d4 (or 2d8 if you had advantage)

**Bleed Thresholds by Size:**

*   Small/Medium: 12
*   Large: 16
*   Huge: 20
*   Gargantuan: 24

**Hemorrhage:** When the counter reaches threshold, dark blood erupts from all wounds at once. The target takes **(proficiency bonus + 3)d6 necrotic damage** and the target is slowed until the end of their next turn. The counter resets to 0.

**Slow Condition:** An affected target's speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

**Counter Reset:** If you don't attack the tracked creature on your turn, the counter drops to 0. You can only track one creature at a time.   
  
Any magical healing reduces the bleed counter by the amount healed (minimum 0)
